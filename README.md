This repository provides a bunch of scripts necessary to run a minimum local K8s cluster for testing and learning purpose. Later it can be extended for production usage.

VirtualBox, Vagrant and Kubeadm are used for Virtualization, VMs deployment and K8s Cluster bootstrap.

In order to run this cluster on your local machine, please go thought the following docs:

- [prerequisites](./docs/prerequisites.md)
