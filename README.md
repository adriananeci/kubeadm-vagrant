# Kuberntes cluster setup with Kubeadm, Vagrant, VirtualBox

This repository provides a bunch of scripts necessary to run a minimum local K8s cluster for testing and learning purpose.
The virtualization part is done through [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the deployment with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and the K8s Cluster setup with [Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm).

In order to run this cluster on your local laptop or PC, please go thought the following docs:
